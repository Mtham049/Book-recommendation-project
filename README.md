### To make book recommendations using content-based filtering, we are attempting to extract the hyperlinks and tags that are kept on the Wikipedia article for each specific book.
### The author,genre, and title of the book will all be included in our final data set, along with all the hyperlinks
or tags. 
### The 12000 rows of books in our base dataset, each of which includes a book id, book
name, genre, and author, were used to build the final dataset by iteratively processing the data
for each book.
